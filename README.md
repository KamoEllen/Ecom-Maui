## My Journey

This is my second MAUI project, which I completed in just 2 days. The development process was straightforward:

1. I designed the user interface in Figma, creating wireframes and visual designs
2. Then I implemented the design using .NET MAUI with C#

It's a simple e-commerce application with just two screens:
- Home page showing products
- Product detail page

I've included a demo video showing the app's functionality:
